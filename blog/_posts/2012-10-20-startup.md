Reading about business and law I have found some parallels to computing.  
- In computing we move data, in business you move capital.  
- In software, the compiler enforces the rules of the language; in business, contracts and the courts enforce the rules.  
- Untested legal scenarios are like leaky abstractions. 

Atleast a software business should be a little like software, even if I am completely wrong about everything else...
