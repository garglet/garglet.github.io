I have been reading about business and law as we work on this startup.  I realized business is similar to computing.  
- In computing we move data, in business you move capital.  
- In software, the compiler enforces the rules of the language.  
- In business, contracts and the courts enforce the rules.  
- Untested legal scenarios are like leaky abstractions where the limits of physics or people creep in. 

Atleast a software business should be a little like software, even if I am completely wrong about everything else...
