* The scrolling function has the potential to
substantially reduce repetitive motion injuries.
When I use the scroll function my wrist and
hand are noticeably less fatigued.

* The edge detection on height, and width
functions work well enough that no adjustment
or only minor adjustments need to be
made on most measurements.

* The use of shortcuts have definitely made
reporting more fun and efficient.

* The functions I particularly value are the
semiautomated “push” to AQnet, to be able
to scroll with holding the mouse down (a function
sadly lost with our isite upgrade) and the
hot key for arrows to annotate.

* The tools that you have provided for the division
are exceptional.
