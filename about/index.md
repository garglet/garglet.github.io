Garglet provides a collection of user interface
enhancements for radiologists. We enable
seemless integrating between PACS (Picture
Archiving and Communication System),
voice recognition and EHRs. We also provide
customized solutions to optimize workstation
hardware, remote reading, and backend
systems.

Founder Dr. Garg started customizing his
own clinical workflow on the computer in
residency. Many of the widgets he developed
were adopted by his co-residents and
attendings. These gadgets came to be known
as garglets.

Garglets significantly relieved the pain and
repetitive stresses of scrolling and navigating
images for hours on end. He modified
garglets to work on various different PACS
implementations at various hospitals that he
rotated through during residency, fellowship,
and as a junior academic faculty. However,
with the increasing regulations controlling
conservative healthcare IT, it became
apparent that widespread adoption in
hospitals would require providing enterprise
level support backed by a business team.
