I had been using win32 com for the glue between autohotkey and python.  But that was limiting with multiple machines and operating systems.  So I finally got around to getting zeromq working in autohotkey: [ahkzmq](http://github.com/tinku99/ahkzmq).


{% highlight ahk %}
z := zstart("tcp://localhost:5555")
omsg := ["what", "else"]
zsendrcv(z, omsg)
return

{% endhighlight %}
